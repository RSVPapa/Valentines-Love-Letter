            <p>HAPPY VALENTINES BABY! Grabe, it's already been so long ever since I confessed my feelings to you, and until now, I still remember the awkwardness that we both felt that day HSBAHBAHSA. 
            Having this feeling reminds me of how long we've already been together and all of the stuff that we've went through. I am very very VERY confident that you're going to be surprised about this type 
            valentines letter and siguro you wouldn't really expect me to do it kasi it's not really my style but guess what, I just want to do something special for you this time and I want to do it in the CompSci way, 
            so here we are! Having all these feelings and memories with you reminds me of how long we've already been together and all of the stuff that we've went through. Walang AI-AI  'to ah (si Ai-Ai Delas Alas lang HAHAHAHHAHA) 
            so wag ka diyan.

            <p>Anyways! after all of these years and after ALLL that we've been through, I just want to say that I'm incredibly grateful to have you in my life baby. You have always been my rock, my parenter-in-crime, my (sometimes) nanay, and my best friend. 
            I can't imagine going through life's ups and downs without you by my side. I think we can all say that you've already seen some would say, the worst of me, but I would say that it's the true me. And one thing's for sure is that you were present 
            through all of it, mapa-Pokemon pa man yan or Gundam, F1, John Mayer, Matt Maltese, or kung whatever man yung maisipan kong magustuhan some random time of the year HAHHAHBABAHB. I'm proud and happy to say that in all of my phases, you still choose
            to stay and love me for who I am, and that is worth more than every kiss, every hug, and every compliment you've ever given me.
            </p>

                I know that we still have a long way to go, and it's inevitable that we will face more challenges and obstacles that we have to work through in the future, but I want you to know that I am ready to face them together with you baby! There are moments
                that I doubt myself and my capabilities as your parter, and its sad to say that I think there are some times na nagkukulang ako sayo in terms of being a good, supportive, and present boyfriend, but I want to let you know that I am always trying my best
                to be bterr for you and for us, and I am committed to working on myself better and tackling all the obstacles and challenges we have to face. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There are a few gifts that I've given you and some of them you may be surpised and baka magulat ka rin sa isa kong surprise HAHABHABJABA but! It's all prepared becasue I want to make you happy in this special day. I hope you enjoy and use them well! To conclude,
                I want to say that for the year of 2026, it won't be as easy as it is before. We're already growing up and facing things that we're definitely not accustomed to, and I think that some of those things are eexperiences that will permanently change our mindsets and
                thoughts about the current state of ourselves. But, I just want to let you know that no matter what mindset that might change about me, kahit ano man yung magbago sa akin, my love for you will never falter and waver baby. Here's to forever my love.
            </p>

                I LOVE YOU BABY! HAPPY VALENTINES!  &hearts;
